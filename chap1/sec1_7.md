## The operating System Manages the Hardware ##
<i>Operating System: </i> is a layer of software interposed between the application program and the hardware.
Two main purposes: (i): to protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications (ii): to provide applications
with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices.
### Processes ###
A <i>process</i> is the operating system's abstraction for a running program. Multiple processes can run concurrently on the same system,
and each process appears to have exclusive use of the hardware. By concurrently, we mean that the instructions of one process are interleaved
with the instructions of another process.
