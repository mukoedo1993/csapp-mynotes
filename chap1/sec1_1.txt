The representation of hello.c illustrates a fundamental idea: all information in a system -- including disk files, programs stored in memory, 
user data stored in memory, and data transfered across a network -- is represented as a bunch of bits. The only thing that distinguishes different data
objects is the context in which we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes might represent an integer, floating-point 
number, character string, or machine instruction.
