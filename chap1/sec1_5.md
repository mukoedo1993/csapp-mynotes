## caches Matter ##
Because of physical laws, larger storage devices are slower than smaller storage devices. And faster devices are more
expensive to build than their slower counterparts.  <---  <i>processor memory gap</i>
Solution:
<i>cache memories</i>
An `L1 cache` on the processor chip holds tens of thousands of bytes and can be accessed to millions of bytes is connected
to the processor by a special bus. `L2 cache` slower than L1, but larger than L1 and still faster than memory.
