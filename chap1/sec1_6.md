## Storage Devices From a Hierarchy ##
The main idea of a memory hierarchy is that storage at one level serves as a cache for storage at the next lower level.<br>
Thus, the register file is a cache for the L1 cache. Caches L1 and L2 are caches for L2 and L3, respectively. <-- the L3 cache is a cache for the main memory,
which is a cache for the disk . 
The local disk serves as a cache for data stored on the disks of other systems.
